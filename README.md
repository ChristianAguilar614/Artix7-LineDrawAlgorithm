# Artix7-LineDrawAlgorithm
Xilinx Vivado based project in Verilog that utilizes Bresenhamâ€™s Line Algorithm developed by Jack Bresenham with hardware implementation help by Stephen Edwards of Columbia University Computer Science Department.

This implementation works with for the 100Mhz generated clock onboard the Arxtix-7 based BASYS 3 Board by Digilent. It will comply with VESA Display Monitor Standards @ 640 xy 480 pixle resolution. To test the algorithm a .TIFF file will be generated on simulation that will indicated correct logical functionality along with VGA output of the algorithm.
